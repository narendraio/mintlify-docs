Heatmaphero takes user data privacy and security seriously. Here's an overview of how user data is handled:

**Anonymization of User Data:** Heatmaphero anonymizes and aggregates user data to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of individual users' information. Personal identifiers are masked or removed from the collected data.
  
**Data Encryption:** User data, including session recordings and heatmaps, is encrypted during transmission and storage. This encryption ensures the data remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.

**User Data Retention:** Heatmaphero allows users to define their data retention policies. Users can set the duration for which data is stored, allowing for compliance with data privacy regulations and minimizing unnecessary data retention.
